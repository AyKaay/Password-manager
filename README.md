Simple password manager

Created by AyKaay in Python as a simple projects for CS50

How it works? Well, it's quite simple really.

There's only 3 options (well, the fourth hasnt been implemented yet),
  input password, see stored password, and preview how the encrypted password would look like.
  The input would be encrypted first and then stored in the database. The user would be asked to input their own masterkey in which to access the
  passwords stored within, mismatched masterkey would not display anything on the output. Thats about it really.
  I was about to create the GUI for the whole program but im just to lazy or lose motivation.

There's a lot of TODO incase, me want to get back:
TODO : Create a GUI
TODO : Implement a delete option from the database
TODO : optional, double encrypt the database too.

Anyway, this was CS50.
